      <description>Angular and Spring Boot are pretty widely used technologies nowadays. Both projects are mature, well documented and supported by large community. That is why I decided to show you how to build self contained Angular 8 application backed with the Spring Boot 2 App.
Code shown in this tutorial might be used as starter template for your own project. All the code is available on my github.

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any experience in building a blog yet but as an engineer I had some vision and principles I wanted to follow. Some of them:
 Simplicity and minimalism Readability Ease of configuration Themes available - because I want to deliver fast to stay in the fun zone Possibility to extend later  The easiest way would be to setup blog on a Wordpress powered hosting but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like fun to me ;) I&amp;rsquo;ve done some research and found out that static site generator would be the perfect solution here.</description>
