Recently I started searching for a comment system I could use on this blog.
Pretty standard functionality for a blog, but as this is static site,
there is no option/plugin included by default.

After some time spent on research I ended up with Disqus - I know there is a ton 
of hate over this platform recently but honestly installation is super easy - 
needs just copy-pasting some html/js code, generating id and you are set.

I did, as I thought and after few minutes it was ready.

What I found out:

There is a free plan, but this shows a ton of ads around the comments section
which is unacceptable for me.
I don't consider paid plan (at least 11$/month) because this blog is a hobby project
so I don't want to invest too much at start.

UPDATE: There is a statement that when you run personal blog, nonprofit or edu sites,
advertising is optional.

I am going to apply for this free-plus plan and we will see how it works - for the moment I turn off
the comments system because this is garbage in the free plan.
