Both projects are mature, well documented and supported by large community. That is why I decided to show you how to build self contained Angular 8 application backed with the Spring Boot 2 App.\nCode shown in this tutorial might be used as starter template for your own project. All the code is available on my github.\nStep 1 - Generate the Spring Boot App Go to https://start.spring.io/ and pick:\n Maven project Pick the Spring Boot version (I checked 2.2.7) Type in the project metadata for Maven build: group, artifact, name, description and package name Pick your Java version (I checked 14) with Jar packaging. No dependencies for now - you can add them if you need anything.  Your are now ready to generate your project package so push the Generate button. Download and extract application to your workspace.\nStep 2 - Angular client Now you are ready to scaffold the Angular Client. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have the Angular CLI setup yet your can go through Get started section of https://angular.io/docs\ngo to your project directory and type:\n$ ng new client\nYou will have to answer some question about your app configuration - Routing and Stylesheet format. Then press enter and within few seconds you have your client app generated.\nIt is in client directory so we will have to move it to the root of your project to have nice sources structure under /src/\n$ cp -R client/* ./\nThen you can remove the client directory which is empty now.\n$ rm -rf ./client\nStep 3 - Integrate Angular build with your Maven build You should have your project imported to your favorite IDE by now.\nManaging node and npm versions across multiple development environments is a pain in the ass of the every developer so ideally we would like to have the exact same configuration (versions of tools and dependencies) everywhere we build the application. This is exactly what Frontent-Maven-Plugin provides! Plugin is available here together with some example configuration end docs.\nBelow I have prepared the configuration for out project. You can add it to your pom.xml:\n\u0026lt;build\u0026gt; \u0026lt;plugins\u0026gt; \u0026lt;plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;org.springframework.boot\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.github.eirslett\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;frontend-maven-plugin\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;1.9.1\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;configuration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;nodeVersion\u0026gt;v10.16.0\u0026lt;/nodeVersion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/configuration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;executions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;execution\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;install node and npm\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;goals\u0026gt; \u0026lt;goal\u0026gt;install-node-and-npm\u0026lt;/goal\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/goals\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/execution\u0026gt; \u0026lt;execution\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;npm install\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;goals\u0026gt; \u0026lt;goal\u0026gt;npm\u0026lt;/goal\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/goals\u0026gt; \u0026lt;configuration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;arguments\u0026gt;install\u0026lt;/arguments\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/configuration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/execution\u0026gt; \u0026lt;execution\u0026gt; \u0026lt;id\u0026gt;npm run build\u0026lt;/id\u0026gt; \u0026lt;goals\u0026gt; \u0026lt;goal\u0026gt;npm\u0026lt;/goal\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/goals\u0026gt; \u0026lt;configuration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;arguments\u0026gt;run build\u0026lt;/arguments\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/configuration\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/execution\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/executions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/plugin\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/plugins\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/build\u0026gt; This adds frontent-maven-plugin to our build. You can see we have the node version configured so you can insert your preferred one.\nIn executions section I have added steps for installing node, installing project dependencies and building the client app. It is now part of the Maven build.\nYou can now install the node and all dependencies by running in the console:\n$ ./mvnw generate-resources\nIt will download node with npm locally and build the application.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget to add node and node_modules directories to your .gitignore file - you don\u0026rsquo;t want to push a ton of dependencies to the git repo!\n$ echo 'node' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .gitignore\n$ echo 'node_modules' \u0026gt;\u0026gt; .gitignore\nStep 4 - Running the build You can test the build by running:\n$ mvn clean package\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to generate all these on your own - I published a template project on my github\n","permalink":"https://tpalucki.github.io/posts/spring-boot-with-angular-tutorial/","summary":"Angular and Spring Boot are pretty widely used technologies nowadays.
