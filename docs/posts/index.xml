      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any experience in building a blog yet but as an engineer I had some vision and principles I wanted to follow. Some of them are:
 Simplicity and minimalism Readability Ease of configuration Themes available - because I want to deliver fast to stay in the fun zone Possibility to extend later (comments etc)  The easiest way would be to setup blog on a Wordpress powered hosting but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound like fun to me üòÅ I&amp;rsquo;ve done some research and found out that static site generator would be the perfect solution here.</description>

      <description>Recently I started searching for a comment system I could use on this blog. Pretty standard functionality for a blog, but as this is static site, there is no option/plugin included by default.
After some time spent on research I ended up with Disqus - I know there is a ton of hate over this platform recently but honestly installation is super easy - needs just copy-pasting some html/js code, generating id and you are set.</description>

      <description>Angular and Spring Boot are pretty widely used technologies nowadays. Both projects are mature, well documented and supported by large community. That is why I decided to show you how to build self contained Angular 8 application backed with the Spring Boot 2 App.
Code shown in this tutorial might be used as starter template for your own project. All the code is available on my github.
Step 1 - Generate the Spring Boot App Go to https://start.</description>
